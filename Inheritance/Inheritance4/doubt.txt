why is this working? 

default void methodA() { 
    int x = 10; 
    System.out.println("x in methodA: " + x); 
} 

and this is not working? 

void methodA() { 
    int x = 10; 
    System.out.println("x in methodA: " + x); 
}

ANSWER:

⚙️ The Difference Lies in the default Keyword
✅ This Works:
default void methodA() {
    int x = 10;
    System.out.println("x in methodA: " + x);
}


👉 Because default methods in interfaces are allowed to have a body.
This feature was introduced in Java 8 to let interfaces provide a default implementation that classes can use or override.

So when you declare it as default, Java knows:

“Okay, this is a method that belongs to an interface and it has an implementation.”

❌ This Doesn’t Work:
void methodA() {
    int x = 10;
    System.out.println("x in methodA: " + x);
}


👉 This fails because, by default, methods in an interface are abstract,
and abstract methods cannot have a body.

So the compiler sees:

“Wait — you didn’t use default, static, or private, but you added a body. That’s illegal in an interface.”

Hence, you’ll get a compile-time error like:

error: interface abstract methods cannot have body

🧠 Summary
Declaration	Allowed?	Reason
void methodA();	✅	Abstract method (no body)
default void methodA() { ... }	✅	Default method with body (Java 8+)
static void methodA() { ... }	✅	Static method with body (Java 8+)
void methodA() { ... }	❌	Abstract method cannot have body
