What Is an Exception?

An exception is an abnormal event that stops the normal flow of a program.

Example:

Dividing by zero
File not present
Wrong input
Database connection failure
Array index out of range
Java handles these using a special mechanism called Exception Handling.


Why Exception Handling Exists?

To prevent the program from crashing.
To handle errors gracefully.
To separate normal logic from error-handling logic.




Exception Hierarchy in Java


                   Object
                      |
                   Throwable
             ---------------------
             |                   |
          Error             Exception
                                  |
                   ------------------------------
                   |                            |
         Checked Exceptions         Unchecked Exceptions (RuntimeException)


Error → Not recoverable (JVM issues)

Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError

Exception → Recoverable

Two types:

Checked Exceptions

Compiler checks these → force you to handle
Examples: FileNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException

Unchecked Exceptions

Runtime errors → not checked by compiler
Examples: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException



How to Handle Exceptions

Using these keywords:

Keyword	                    Meaning
try	                Code that may cause exception
catch	            Handles the exception
finally	            Runs always (cleanup)
throw	            Manually throw an exception
throws	            Declare that a method may throw exception




What is Nested try in Java?

A nested try means placing one try block inside another try block.

You use it when:

You have multiple risky operations inside a bigger risky operation.
You want different levels of exception handling.
Some errors should be handled locally, while others should be handled globally.
