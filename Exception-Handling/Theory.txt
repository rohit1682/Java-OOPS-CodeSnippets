What Is an Exception?

An exception is an abnormal event that stops the normal flow of a program.

Example:

Dividing by zero
File not present
Wrong input
Database connection failure
Array index out of range
Java handles these using a special mechanism called Exception Handling.


Why Exception Handling Exists?

To prevent the program from crashing.
To handle errors gracefully.
To separate normal logic from error-handling logic.




Exception Hierarchy in Java


                   Object
                      |
                   Throwable
             ---------------------
             |                   |
          Error             Exception
                                  |
                   ------------------------------
                   |                            |
         Checked Exceptions         Unchecked Exceptions (RuntimeException)


Error → Not recoverable (JVM issues)

Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError

Exception → Recoverable

Two types:

Checked Exceptions

Compiler checks these → force you to handle
Examples: FileNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException

Unchecked Exceptions

Runtime errors → not checked by compiler
Examples: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException



How to Handle Exceptions

Using these keywords:

Keyword	                    Meaning
try	                Code that may cause exception
catch	            Handles the exception
finally	            Runs always (cleanup)
throw	            Manually throw an exception
throws	            Declare that a method may throw exception




What is Nested try in Java?

A nested try means placing one try block inside another try block.

You use it when:

You have multiple risky operations inside a bigger risky operation.
You want different levels of exception handling.
Some errors should be handled locally, while others should be handled globally.



Throw — manually throwing an exception

You use throw when you want to create and throw an exception yourself.

⭐ Key points:

Used inside a method / block.

Creates an exception object.
Immediately stops execution and jumps to the nearest catch.
You throw one exception at a time.

✔ Example:
public class Test {
    void checkAge(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible to vote");
        }
        System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test t = new Test();
        t.checkAge(16);
    }
}


Output:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Not eligible to vote


Throws — declaring that a method might throw an exception

You use throws when:

A method might throw a checked exception.
You don't want to handle it inside the method.
You pass the responsibility to the caller.

⭐ Key points:

Used in method signature.
Declares potential exceptions.
Mostly for checked exceptions (e.g., IOException).

✔ Example:
public class Demo {
    void readFile() throws IOException {
        FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("data.txt");  
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Demo d = new Demo();
            d.readFile();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("File error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

Simple analogy

throw → throwing a ball
You actually throw the ball.
throws → warning that you might throw a ball
You tell the other person:
“Be ready, I might throw this ball at you.”
