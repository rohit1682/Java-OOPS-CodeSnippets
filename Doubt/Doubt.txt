what is the difference between these two lines? 

Parent ob1 = new Child(); 
Child ob2 = new Child();

ANSWER:


1. Parent ob1 = new Child();

The object is of type Child
The reference is of type Parent

ob1 can only access the methods and variables defined in Parent 
(even though it’s a Child object underneath).
However, if a method is overridden, the Child’s 
version will execute — this is runtime polymorphism.

class Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Parent show"); }
}
***********************************************************
class Child extends Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Child show"); }
    void display() { System.out.println("Child display"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent ob1 = new Child();
        ob1.show();     // ✅ allowed (Parent method)
        // ob1.display(); // ❌ not allowed (Parent reference doesn’t know this)
    }
}


2. Child ob2 = new Child();

Both the reference and the object are of type Child.
You can access everything in Child, including all inherited stuff from Parent.

Child ob2 = new Child();
ob2.show();     // ✅ from Parent, overridden in Child
ob2.display();  // ✅ from Child
