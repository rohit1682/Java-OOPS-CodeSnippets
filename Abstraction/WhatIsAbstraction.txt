🟦 What is Abstraction in Java?

Abstraction means showing only essential details to the user and hiding the internal complexity.

Think of it like:

You drive a car by steering, braking, accelerating.
But you don’t see how the fuel injects, how the engine burns it, or how the ECU controls the car.
Java uses abstraction so the programmer focuses on what to do, not how it works internally.

🟧 Why is abstraction important?

✔ Reduces complexity
✔ Improves code readability
✔ Makes code modification easier
✔ Ensures security by hiding data
✔ Helps achieve loose coupling

🟦 Ways to Achieve Abstraction in Java

There are two primary ways:

1️⃣ Abstract Classes (0–100% Abstraction)
📌 What is an abstract class?

A class declared with abstract keyword.
Can have both abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with body).
Cannot create objects of an abstract class.

📌 When to use?

When classes share a common base but implementations differ.
When you want partial abstraction.

✔ Example:
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound(); // abstract method

    void sleep() {         // concrete method
        System.out.println("Animal is sleeping");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound();
        a.sleep();
    }
}

2️⃣ Interfaces (100% Abstraction)
📌 What is an interface?

A blueprint of a class.
Contains abstract methods by default (Java 8+ also allows default and static methods).
A class must implement an interface and provide the method definitions.
Supports multiple inheritance, which abstract classes do not.

📌 When to use?

When you need full abstraction.
When multiple unrelated classes must follow the same rules.

✔ Example:
interface Vehicle {
    void start(); // abstract by default
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with key");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Car();
        v.start();
    }
}

🟦 Abstract Class vs Interface — Quick Comparison
Feature	                Abstract Class	                Interface
Method types	        Abstract + concrete	            Abstract, default, static
Variables	            Can have variables	            Only public static final constants
Constructor	            Yes	                            No
Multiple inheritance	❌ No	                      ✅ Yes
Abstraction level	    0–100%	                        100%


🟧 Bonus: Abstraction also achieved through…

Although not primary methods, Java also uses:

✔ Encapsulation

Hiding internal data using private fields + public methods indirectly supports abstraction.

✔ Packages

They hide internal classes and expose only necessary APIs.

🟦 Summary

Abstraction = Hiding implementation + Showing essential features

Achieved by:

Abstract classes
Interfaces

Use:

Abstract class when partial abstraction and shared code.
Interface when full abstraction or multiple inheritance.
