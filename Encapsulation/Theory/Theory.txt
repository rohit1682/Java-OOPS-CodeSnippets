🧩 What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation means binding data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, while restricting direct access to the data from outside.

In Java, this is achieved through:

Private fields (data hiding)

Public getters/setters (controlled access)

Packages (access boundaries)

🧱 How Packages Support Encapsulation

A package in Java is like a folder that groups related classes.
It not only organizes code but also controls visibility between classes.

Packages + access modifiers (private, default, protected, public) together create encapsulation boundaries.

🔒 Example: Without Encapsulation

All fields are public — anyone can access or modify them from anywhere.

// File: com/company/Employee.java
package com.company;

public class Employee {
    public String name;
    public double salary;
}

// File: com/client/Main.java
package com.client;
import com.company.Employee;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.name = "Rohit";
        emp.salary = -10000;  // ❌ Invalid but allowed
        System.out.println(emp.name + " earns " + emp.salary);
    }
}


➡️ Here, salary can be set to an invalid value.
There’s no control or data protection — encapsulation is broken.

✅ Example: With Encapsulation (Using Packages + Access Modifiers)
// File: com/company/Employee.java
package com.company;

public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;

    // Setter (validation included)
    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        if (salary > 0) this.salary = salary;
        else System.out.println("Invalid salary!");
    }

    // Getter
    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// File: com/client/Main.java
package com.client;
import com.company.Employee;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.setName("Rohit");
        emp.setSalary(-10000);   // Will trigger validation
        System.out.println(emp.getName() + " earns " + emp.getSalary());
    }
}

🔍 How This Demonstrates Encapsulation

Aspect	Explanation
Private variables	Prevents direct access to sensitive data (salary, name).
Public methods	Provides controlled access through getters/setters.
Packages	Restrict class visibility between modules — only what’s public is visible outside com.company.
Access Modifiers	Work with packages to define what’s visible within or outside the package.


🧠 Analogy

Think of a package as a capsule 🧴 containing related classes.
Encapsulation ensures that only necessary methods are exposed outside, while internal data remains hidden and protected.

🧭 Summary

Concept	Role in Encapsulation
Private fields	Hide data inside the class
Public getters/setters	Control external access
Package	Defines module boundaries
Access modifiers	Control visibility across packages
